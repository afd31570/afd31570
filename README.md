A husband of 15 years. Father of 2 children. educator and self-learning student of 34 years. Not waiting for respect and love; who tries to earn and give respect and love, who sees humanity above all values. At the same time, I was able to manage any crisis I faced in life. I am a laborer who attaches importance to task sharing in both the waitressing and bossing.     

I participated in a USA based Boot - Camp certification program .  I obtained the Full Stack Java Developer Certificate.  In this context, we were preparing 1 small and 2 large projects.  The smaller one was the ATM project.  One of the big ones was Car Rental and the other was the Library project.  These will be completed with both front end and back end parts.  A team was formed and worked.  The simulation was made as if you were working in the real market.
