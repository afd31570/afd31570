 API: Application Programming Interface
                it helps the software applications to communicate with each other.
                When you are a developer, you need to customize your api endpoints
                API
                Request       and       Response
                we need;
                url / endpoint :  base url + path parameters + query params

                What http Request methods do we have in API?
                Get: read data
                Post: create data
                Put: update data
                Patch : update data partially
                Delete: delete data
                Then we can validate everything with status codes and body(data)
                Status codes
                200: OK
                201: Created
                202: accepted
                204: No content
                400: Bad request
                401: Unauthorized
                404: Not Found
                GET, DELETE : The body required => false
                POST, PUT, PATCH : The body required => true

                Authentication        vs       Authorization
                General access                 specific access
                admin user
                username : admin

                password : patient123
                Authenticated = true
                Authorization level : only their records
                non existing user
                username : invalid
                password : invalid
                Authenticated => no

                Hemchrest mathcers
                assertions
                soft and hard assertions
                response.then.assertThat().getStatusCode().body("name", equalTo())
                //Hard assertion : if execution fails at some point, the whole execution will stop / dependent scenarios
                //Soft assrtion : if any scenario fails, it will keep executing the rest of the scenarios / independent scenarios

                Relation with others?
                When you have a conflict with testers, how do you rsolve it?
                You know we already work in a professional environment and we have specific trainings about work ethics and company policy. We are not choosing to blame any one or any characters, but we always try to find solutions if we get any problems or issues.
                We just organize meetings between team members and communicate the issues to produce a solution.
                So nothing is personal! Everybody is here for the same purpose to make contributions to the business.
                Have you had any problems with your team members in your working life? What did you do as a team leader?
                In my team, there was a misunderstanding of requirement and somebody else thought that I was responsible for it.
                But we did communicate the issue in the daily stand up and clarified that one of us was working for it. Actually it was not my responsibility, but I asked my team mate if they would be able to elabore on this story. He said he would not have enough time and then I covered it.
